If you have any question about this package, please feel free to ask me any
question thru above email.

This package just can be used in Adobe TMXtoMosesTools project internally, don't
distribute this package.

* What's chasen?
----------------

Chasen is a Japanese Word Segmentor, which was developed by 奈良先端科学技術大学
院大学情報科学研究科自然言語処理学講座(松本研究室), and depends on the
Darts(Double-ARray Trie System).

You can find more information on http://chasen.naist.jp.

Recently version:
 - Chasen 2.4.4
 - Darts 0.3.2

* Chasen and Encoding Support

Originally, Chasen support the encoding EUC-JP and UTF-8 both. But
unfortunately, we cannot support them simultaneously. We have to convert the
encoding of dictionary files and configuration file into UTF-8. You can refer
the URL http://www.crimson-snow.net/hmsvr/centos/memo/chasen_utf8.html and the
Makefile in dic directory in this package.

Now, the chasen in this package support the UTF-8.

* How to use the Chasen.
------------------------

# use the chasen to tokenize the Japanese text.
$ ./chasen -i w input.file > output.file

* How to install the chasen.
----------------------------

# compile and build the chasen and dic tools.
$ cd src
$ make
$ make install

The installation step will copy the makemat and makeda into the dic directory.
Then you can change the working directory into dic, which include all source dic
files and grammar files, and run the make to create the matrix.cha, table.cha
and dictionary file (default named as chadic.*) used by chasen.

$ ./makemat -i w
$ ./makeda -i w chadic *.dic

you can create the grammar and dic files just by running make.
$ make

* Configuration
Please put the configuration file 'chasenrc' with the same directory as chasen.
This configuration file should be same encoding as what you want to support,
i.e. UTF-8 in this package.

And you can customize this file to get the different output, specify the
location for dic file.

* Motivation
Why creating this package or not use the original tar package distributed by
original author?

 - We want that chasen can support UTF-8 in our project, so we have to convert
 some files and creating some new files.

 - We will run the chasen on MacOSX, we have to generate some source file for
 this platform. I run the configure script in original package to create the
 config.h and darts.h for MacOSX.

 - We will call the chasen in our tools, and want to simplify the installation.
 So I put the all source files into one folder, and create one binary executable
 file.
