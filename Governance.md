#summary This document describes agreements and conventions governing the project.

# Decision Making #
"Moses for Localization" (M4Loc) is a project for and by the community. As such decisions, if at all possible, should be reached by consensus on the public mailing list. In the cases where this is not possible, a vote can be taken. Each contributing organization has one vote and votes are decided by simple majority in a public vote on the mailing list. Ties will be broken by a coin toss.

# Check-in Privileges #
Check-in privileges can be requested from the project administrator. Check-in privileges are decided using the decision making process above, except that discussions and votes are non-public. It is preferable if applicants for check-in privileges have made contributions to the project before, e.g. by entering bugs, submitting patches on the mailing list or writing documentation. Demonstrated knowledge in the localization, internationalization and machine translation fields can serve as substitute for previous project contributions.

# Contributor License Agreements #
M4Loc requires signed Contributor License Agreements from individuals ([Individual Contributor License Agreement V1.0](http://code.google.com/p/m4loc/downloads/detail?name=icla.pdf&can=2&q=)) and organizations ([Corporate Contributor License Agreement V1.0](http://code.google.com/p/m4loc/downloads/detail?name=ccla.pdf&can=2&q=)) contributing code, data or documentation to M4Loc.

Contributor license agreements provide legal protection for project contributors and users. In the case of a contributing organization, the organization has to sign the CCLA and each individual contributor from the organization a CLA.

# Sponsorship Program #
M4Loc offers these sponsorship levels:
  * Gold: $2500 labor or monetary contribution
  * Silver: $1000 labor or monetary contribution
  * Bronze: $500 labor or monetary contribution
Software development labor contributions are counted at a rate of $80/hour; language consulting, testing, project management and technical writing at $50/hour.

In recognition of sponsorship the sponsoring organization’s logo will be displayed on the project front page (maximum size 150x75 pixels; ordered alphabetically on a possibly shared row).

In the case of monetary contributions, it is preferable if the sponsor specifies the purpose the amount should go towards. If the purpose of the monetary contribution is not specified, the funds will be used for the administration of the project. In case there are extra funds without specified purpose, the fund allocation will be decided by the community using the decision making process described above. Preference should be given to maintain a well-documented, well-tested project with a healthy community over new code developments.

A progress report, including financial information, will be distributed to all sponsors in March and October.

The M4Loc project is currently not organized as a separate entity under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code in the United States.
