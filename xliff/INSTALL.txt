INSTALLATION
==============
There is no need to have a special installation procedure. It is sufficient to
simply copy all scripts into one directory.


SCRIPT EXECUTION
==================
Linux/Unix:
if it is a modullino (pm suffix):
perl script.pm
otherwise:
./script.pl

Windows:
perl script

There is one central script called m4loc.pl. This script runs all the 
others which user is not expected to know or modify in any way. 
The user is required to adjust CAREFULLY all variables only in the m4loc 
script (external programs names and options). When all the paths and variables 
are set, the script can be executed:

./m4loc.pl -i my_file.xlf
or:
perl m4loc.pl -sl en -tl de -i my_file.xlf


perl will start m4loc script with source language: English (en) and target 
language: German (de). The script continually process input file (-i my_file.xlf). 
The result (original file + translation) is written out as my_file.out.xlf
