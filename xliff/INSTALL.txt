=============================

Perl v 5.10.0
Okapi Tikal ( code.google.com/p/okapi/downloads/list , documentation: 
www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Tikal )


INSTALLATION
==============
There is no need to have a special installation procedure. It is sufficient to
simply copy all scripts into one directory.


SCRIPT EXECUTION
==================
Linux/Unix:
./script_name

Windows:
perl script_name

Example:
./mod_tokenizer.pl -l en < INF > OUTF

perl will execute the script mod_tokenizer.pl with the -l option set to "en". 
The input is "INF" (it can be a file, or other standard input). The output 
"OUTF" is regular file. If no output is specified, it will be written to the
standard output (most often it is displayed).

For a deeper understanding of scripts, read README.txt
